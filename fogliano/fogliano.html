<p>
Usually this error comes up because your IP address has been making too many requests, or you're trying to access GPS Visualizer with some sort of automated system.
</p>

<p>
If you want to rig up a legitimate service that works automatically with GPS Visualizer, please <a href="mailto:bugs-15+79.33.215.37&#64;gpsvisualizer.com">send an e-mail</a> and explain what you're trying to accomplish, and we might be able to help.  (Although if you need a geocoding API, it would be faster and more efficient to access Bing or Google directly.)
